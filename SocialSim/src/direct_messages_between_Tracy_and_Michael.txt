Hey Michael, really loved your intro! In fact, I strongly resonate with your emphasis on critical thinking in decision-making. I'm considering adopting a system where individual insights and collective decisions form a symbiotic relationship. Your viewpoint could add an interesting layer to this system. What are your thoughts on this?

Hi Tracy, I'm intrigued by your idea of a system where individual insights and collective decisions form a symbiotic relationship. I believe such a system can facilitate open dialogues and foster informed decision-making based on a broad spectrum of perspectives. That being said, do you have any specific ideas on how we can implement this during the game?

Hey Michael, I've had some discussions with John about fostering a system that balances individual insights and collective decision-making. We're considering an 'open forum' approach where we all get a dedicated time to present our unique perspectives, which are then acknowledged and incorporated into our decision-making process. I remember you mentioning your appreciation for round-robin approaches. I wanted to hear your thoughts on this.

Hi Michael, I wanted to check in after our initial group discussion. John and I have been discussing a mechanism to ensure a balance of individual and collective thought. We are considering proposing an 'open forum' system where each player gets time to share their perspective before each decision. With your strong emphasis on critical thinking, your input would be interesting to hear. What do you think about this?

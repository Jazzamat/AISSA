Hi Tracy,

Hope you're doing well. I am currently working on a report that involves some financial data analysis and I've hit a roadblock. As you are experienced in this field, I believe your insights would be of great help. If possible, could we set up a meeting this week to discuss it? I'm flexible Thursday or Friday, whichever works for you. 

Thanks in advance!

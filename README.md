***Description:***

This topic is based on the recent developments in socially and strategically aware artificial intelligence such as [Cicero](https://www.marktechpost.com/2022/11/24/meet-cicero-an-artificial-intelligence-ai-agent-that-plays-at-a-human-level-in-diplomacy/) developed by [Meta](https://tinyurl.com/y7z8zedv). This AI has generated a lot of interest, including some interesting debates from cognitive scientists such as [Gary Marcus](https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/what-does-meta-ais-diplomacy-winning). This project focus on a specific aspect of Cicero’s algorithm: The way it computes the best response to what other players will do with their next move (check out [the article](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.ade9097) from the library), specifically the type of utility maximisation that accounts for Cicero’s belief regarding its opponents, which is related to the way economic [game theory](https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/23/3/310) describes [strategic interactions](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4336/13/3/46). This is a challenging project where you will be expected to learn some complex ideas related to decision theory, artificial intelligence, and information theory but these concepts will be introduced and discussed so you will only need to have a readiness to learn.
